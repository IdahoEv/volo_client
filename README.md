# Volo Client

This is the browser client for the multiplayer game Volo.  Volo is (rather - will be)
a reimplementation of the classic LAN game "Bolo" by Stuart Cheshire.

My first proof-of-concept code for this project was also my learning project in
Elixir.

## Volo Server

The server is a separate project, it can be found at [IdahoEv/volo_server](https://github.com/IdahoEv/volo_server).
